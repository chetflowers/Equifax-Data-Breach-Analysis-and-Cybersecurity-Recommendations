Introduction
This project explores one of the largest and most significant data breaches in history: the 2017 Equifax data breach. The focus is on understanding how the breach occurred, what vulnerabilities were exploited, and the steps that can be taken to prevent future incidents of this nature.

Attack Category Overview
The Equifax breach falls under the category of **exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities**, specifically leveraging a known Apache Struts vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638). This section covers:
- Attack vectors and techniques.
- Industry statistics on similar attacks.

Company and Incident Summary
- Company: Equifax - A major credit reporting agency.
- Breach Summary: Exploitation of a known vulnerability led to the exposure of personal data for 147 million individuals.
- Data Compromised: Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, and more.

Timeline of Events
A chronological breakdown of key milestones, including:
- March 2017: Apache Struts vulnerability discovered.
- May 2017: Attackers begin exploiting the vulnerability.
- July 2017: Breach detected by Equifax.
- September 2017: Public disclosure of the breach.

Vulnerabilities Identified
1. Failure to Patch Known Vulnerability: The root cause was the failure to apply a patch for the Apache Struts vulnerability.
2. Inadequate Network Segmentation: Poor isolation between IT systems allowed attackers lateral movement within the network.
3. Weak Monitoring and Detection: Delayed detection allowed attackers to remain undetected for over two months.
4. Insufficient Incident Response Planning: The company’s delayed response contributed to the severity of the breach.

Impact and Costs
- Financial Costs: Over $1.4 billion in settlements, fines, and legal fees.
- Reputational Damage: Loss of consumer trust and significant media scrutiny.
- Operational Impact: Extensive costs for IT infrastructure upgrades and ongoing monitoring.

Prevention and Remediation Recommendations
1. Patch Management: Implement automated patch management systems to ensure timely updates.
2. Enhanced Monitoring and Detection: Deploy advanced threat detection systems to identify suspicious activities early.
3. Improved Incident Response Plans: Regularly test and update incident response strategies to minimize damage during future attacks.
4. Network Segmentation: Strengthen network architecture to prevent lateral movement within systems.

Conclusion
This case study highlights the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures and how neglecting fundamental practices like patch management can lead to catastrophic consequences.
